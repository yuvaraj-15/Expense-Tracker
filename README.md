# Expense Tracker Web Application

A full-stack Expense Tracker application containerized using **Docker**.  
The application allows users to manage their personal finances by adding, editing, and deleting transactions, and viewing summaries.

---

## Features

- User registration and login
- Add, edit, and delete transactions
- View total balance, income, expenses, and category-wise summaries
- Persistent storage using PostgreSQL
- Multi-container setup for easy deployment with Docker Compose

---

## Architecture Overview

The application is deployed using three Docker containers:

1. **Backend Container**: Node.js + Express (handles API and business logic)  
2. **Frontend Container**: Static HTML/CSS/JS served via Nginx  
3. **Database Container**: PostgreSQL for persistent transaction and user data  

All containers communicate via Docker's internal network. The frontend is exposed on **port 80** for browser access, while the backend communicates internally on **port 5000**.  

**Note**: End users **do not need to build the images** manually. Simply using the `docker-compose.yml` file will pull the pre-built images from Docker Hub and run the application.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop / Docker Engine
- Docker Compose
- Internet connection (to pull images from Docker Hub)
